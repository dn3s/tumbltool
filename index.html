			<h1>A Better Workflow for Tumblr Themes</h1>
			<p>
				This project was born of frustration with Tumblr's theme editor.
				I had a lot of ideas I wanted to express and found the tools provided by Tumblr presented too much friction.
			</p><p>
				To me, the main selling point for Tumblr is simplicity; it allows you to set up a simple, beautiful blog very quickly and easily.
				Their theme syntax is nice, clean, and declarative, and it really should make developing a theme very fast and easy.
			</p><p>
				Unfortunately, easy as it may be to write and use their themes, <strong>testing</strong> them is a pain.
				And this is critical for any workflow.
			</p><p>
				When I am working on a design, I want to refresh my browser about every 10-30 seconds.
				I don't want to break my concentration to copy-and-paste my code into a browser-based theme editor, and wait 5-10 seconds for the preview to refresh in that weird iframe sidebar thing.
				Even if I wanted to put up with that, I couldn't if I happen to be working somewhere without an internet connection.
			</p><p>
				The goal of this project is to <strong>bring a much-needed dose of sanity to the Tumblr theme development workflow</strong>, by allowing the developer to code in their own environment, instead of relying on Tumblr's network-dependant (and dare I say bloated) environment.
