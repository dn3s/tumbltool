			<h1>A Better Workflow for Tumblr Themes</h1>
			<p>
				This project was born of frustration with Tumblr's theme editor. I had a lot of theme ideas and I wanted to put them out quickly and easily.
				The goal of this project is to bring a much-needed dose of sanity to the Tumblr theme development workflow.</p>
