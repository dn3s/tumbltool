			<h1>A Better Workflow for Tumblr Themes</h1>
			<p>
				This project was born of frustration with Tumblr's theme editor.
				I had a lot of ideas I wanted to express and found the tools provided by Tumblr presented too much friction.
			</p><p>
				To me, the main selling point for Tumblr is simplicity; it allows you to set up a simple, beautiful blog very quickly and easily.
				Their theme syntax is nice, clean, and declarative, and it really should make developing a theme very fast and easy.
			</p><p>
				Unfortunately, easy as it may be to write and use their themes, <strong>testing</strong> them is a pain.
				And this is critical for any workflow.
			</p><p>
				When I am working on a design, I want to refresh my browser about every 10-30 seconds.
				I don't want to break my concentration to copy-and-paste my code into a browser-based theme editor, and wait 5-10 seconds for the preview to refresh in that weird iframe sidebar thing.
				Even if I wanted to put up with that, I couldn't if I happened to be working somewhere without an internet connection.
			</p><p>
				The goal of this project is to <strong>bring a much-needed dose of sanity to the Tumblr theme development workflow</strong>, by allowing the developer to code in their own environment, instead of relying on Tumblr's network-dependant (and dare I say bloated) environment.

			<h1>Why Use TumblTool?</h1>
			<h2>Fast, Comprehensive Previews</h2>
			<p>
				TumblTool eliminates the need to wait on Tumblr's servers to parse your theme and brings the magic to your own machine.
				Written in Perl 5, TumblTool performs the parsing, and renders your theme as if it were applied to an "imaginary blog", with a variety of example content, all in a split second.
				As development continues, the "imaginary blog" will become filled with more content and you will be given more choices for what sort of content you want in your previews.
			</p>
			<h2>Flexible Output</h2>
			<p>
				TumblTool gives you plenty of options for output. It can inline and optionally minify CSS and JS files, strip whitespace, and even wrap everything up in a base64-encoded <code>data: URI</code> for piping into your browser directly!
			</p><p>
				Aside from rendering previews, TumblTool can parse and minify your theme, inline and minify your external files, and bundle it up to be pasted into the Tumblr's HTML editor once the time comes to deploy.
			</p><p>
				 TumblTool gives extensive options regarding which files should be included inline, and which should be left as <code>href</code>s, <code>src</code>s, etc.

			<h1>TumblTool is a Work In Progress</h1>
			<p>
				TumblTool is under active development. At the moment it is a perfectly useable program, but the previews aren't perfect.
				It takes a lot of work to reverse-engineer and re-implement an API, and some of the more complicated features aren't yet ready.
				Any un-implemented variable or block in your theme will simply be left blank, and unsupported parameters will simply not take effect.
			</p><p>
				I've covered most of the basics, to the point that I believe it is a useful tool in this state, but there's still a lot of work to be done. You can see a list of incomplete features <a href="features.html">here</a>.

			<h1>How to Contribute</h1>
			<p>
				TumblTool is designed in a modular fashion, so it's easy to contribute. There's work to be done <strong>whether you are a Perl developer or not.</strong> Read more about it <a href="contributing.html">here</a>!
