Usage: tumbltool <COMMAND> [OPTIONS]

Commands:

preview
Print an example page using the theme specified in FILE, filled with example material from a JSON file (see -content)

bundle
Bundle up a theme with any needed assets into a single file to be pasted into Tumblr. Useful for a sort of ghetto deployment system.

help
Show this help text and exit.

Options:

-c --content <FILE>
Specify content to populate the rendered preview page, either as an absolute or relative path to a JSON file, or the name of one of the bundled content packages (currently only "default" is available).

-d --dataURI
Format output as a base64-encoded data URI, meant for piping into a browser (or sending a link to clients I guess). Example: tumbltool preview --theme your_file_here -dataURI | xargs firefox

-i --include <FILES>
specify CSS or Javscript file(s) to add to the theme, included at the special {tumbltool_includes} tag in your theme file (so make sure to add it, presumably at the end of your theme's <head>. Multiple files can be specified as a space-separated list, or this argument can be added multiple times. You can supply absolute paths, relative paths, or URIs.

-l --inline
Include all local files (not URIs though) inline, using <script> or <style> tags, so the preview or bundle is a single, self-contained file. Also inlines images as Data URIs. Handy for one-step deployment and easy previews, but may hurt performance since browsers won't cache stylesheets, images, or scripts.

-s --strip
Remove unnecessary whitespace, and minify scripts and stylesheets. Useful for keeping file sizes down and ease of sharing.

-v --var ATTRIBUTE=VALUE
Specify custom variables you may have in your theme. (Not yet implemented)

-t --theme FILE
Specify the theme file to preview/bundle.
